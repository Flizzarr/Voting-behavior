# Voting-behavior
Project about modeling voting behaviour.

The ultimate goal is to model changes in voting behaviour as the voter tries to maximize their own utility.

A voter’s utility will be defined as parliament’s similarity to the voter’s personal values.

Voters and parties will have their values represented as a vector with n dimensions.

Each dimension will represent an issue or a group of issues.
